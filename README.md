## How to Run

### Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration.

- For **development**, use `.env.dev` (optimized for Nodemon & hot-reload).
- For **production**, use `.env`.

You can create one quickly by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.dev   # for development
cp .env.example .env       # for production
```

---

### Running with Docker

Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.

#### Development (with hot reload)

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.dev up --build
```

#### Production

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env up --build -d
```

Once containers are running, the API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>
```
